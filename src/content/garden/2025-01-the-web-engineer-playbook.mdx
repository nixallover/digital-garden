## Getting started
When you start learning about software development, it’s good to try everything you can
- Use an “explore” vs an “exploit” algorithm
- Get hands-on experience as much as you can
- Try to find more senior mentors - great if they’re dedicated, but also okay to just bounce ideas off of them occasionally. Treat them with gratitude.

## Engineer
- For the first 5-7 years of your engineering career, focus on getting really good at implementation and technical skills.
- This includes becoming familiar with: UX, accessibility, prototyping, copy writing, react & other libraries, JS/TS, CSS, server-side scripting, browsers and how they work, web architecture, networking, testing, design, etc.
- Find one or two domains to specialize in—Loren’s advice

## Senior engineer
- As you become more senior, it becomes more important to focus on systems and product-oriented thinking
- Understand how to scale and fortify systems
- Owning a product, feature, or domain wholly
- Understanding your work in the context of the business, and discerning what you can do to bring the most value to the business
- In some cases, leading others on your team and leveling them up

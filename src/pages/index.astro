            At university, I trained in drawing and painting, and aspired to
            become a professional illustrator. I still draw as a hobby and
            <strong>illustrate technical topics</strong>, which I find is a fun
            and effective way to democratize complex topics.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-4">
            I‚Äôve always had an affinity for computers and the web. For most of
            the last decade I‚Äôve focused on creating intuitive experiences for
            the web as a software engineer. I‚Äôve worked on small scrappy teams
            where every developer wore many hats, and consulted with large
            organizations like Nintendo and T-Mobile, where teams are quite
            specialized.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-4">
            In the last year, I‚Äôve changed my focus to product. At Nx we‚Äôre
            building <a

              class="underline underline-offset-2">Nx Cloud</a
            >, a powerful platform for achieving fast, reliable CI. It‚Äôs the
            most exciting thing I‚Äôve worked on in my career, and I'm looking
            forward to sharing some of my learnings here.

            I‚Äôm a product manager, software engineer and illustrator based in

          <p>
            At university, I trained in drawing and painting, and aspired to
            become a professional illustrator. I still draw as a hobby and
            <strong>illustrate technical topics</strong>, which I think is a fun
            and effective way to democratize complex topics.
          </p>

            I‚Äôve always had an affinity for computers and the web. For most of
            the last decade I‚Äôve focused on creating intuitive experiences for
            the web as a software engineer. I‚Äôve often worked on small scrappy
            teams where every developer wore many hats, and I‚Äôve also consulted
            with large organizations such as Nintendo and T-Mobile, where teams
            are often quite specialized.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the last year, I‚Äôve changed my focus to product. At Nx we‚Äôre
            building Nx Cloud, a powerful platform for achieving fast, reliable
            CI. It‚Äôs the most exciting thing I‚Äôve worked on in my career.

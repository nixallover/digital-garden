            At university, I trained in drawing and painting, and aspired to
            become a professional illustrator. I still draw as a hobby and
            <strong>illustrate technical topics</strong>, which I think is a fun
            and effective way to democratize complex topics.

            I’ve always had an affinity for computers and the web. For most of
            the last decade I’ve focused on creating intuitive experiences for
            the web as a software engineer. I’ve often worked on small scrappy
            teams where every developer wore many hats, and I’ve also consulted
            with large organizations such as Nintendo and T-Mobile, where teams
            are often quite specialized.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg">
            In the last year, I’ve changed my focus to product. At Nx we’re
            building Nx Cloud, a powerful platform for achieving fast, reliable
            CI. It’s the most exciting thing I’ve worked on in my career.
